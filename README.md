Piquet Calculator was designed to assist in the creation of piquet lists (guard/watch lists)
We've all been stitched up by a sleep-deprived Lance Jack who probably should've failed year 10 maths - don't make the same mistake!

Use this simple tool to quickly and accurately write your piquet lists.

Calculate your list by entering the following info

- Start time

- End time

- Number of Pers

- Single/Double Staggered
